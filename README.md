# arduino-teensy

Bunch of garbage messing around with an Arduino Teensy 4.1

For the Platformio projects:
- follow this to set up VS Code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13wmV6gcb2A&t=442s
- open the individual project dir in VS Code, eg `Bleep Base`
- think an additional header is required: `#include <Arduino.h>`
